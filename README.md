For this project, I decided to make a program that takes the name and weight of a pack, and predicts whether the pack is heavy or light. In order to do this, I needed to create a dictionary of all the packs recorded in an open source excel spreadsheet here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tlkZVdZP41NGNjXFQW84sBhe4AK0OMqjDwrS2FUgfbE/edit?gid=0#gid=0 with their recorded weights and categories. If the user inputs a pack and weight on the spreadsheet, it will output what category it is in. if the information is not recorded it will predict the category whenever possible and update the dictionary. if the prediction is incorrect, it will update the dictionary as well.
